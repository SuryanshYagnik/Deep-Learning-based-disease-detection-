**Identification of Corn Leaf Disease Using Deep Learning**

The rapid identification and early prevention of crop diseases play a pivotal role in enhancing agricultural productivity. This paper presents an innovative approach leveraging deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to effectively identify and diagnose plant diseases based on leaf images. Given the remarkable success of CNNs in machine vision, our implemented models demonstrate promising accuracy in disease identification.

The evaluation of model performance involves tuning various parameters, including batch size, dropout rates, and the number of epochs. Notably, our models, namely CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet, achieved impressive disease-classification accuracy rates of 95.56%, 90.25%, 92.18%, and 93.30%, respectively. These results surpass the performance of traditional handcrafted-feature-based approaches.

The findings underscore the potential of deep CNN models to significantly enhance the efficiency of disease identification, offering promising prospects for real-time implementation in agricultural systems. This research contributes to the advancement of precision agriculture by providing accurate and timely disease diagnosis, thereby supporting sustainable crop management practices.
